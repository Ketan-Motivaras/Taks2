In-App Camera App
Overview
This Android app demonstrates in-app camera functionality with a custom UI similar to the Google Pay QR scanner interface.

Home Screen: Navigate to the camera screen.
Camera Screen: Capture an image using a custom in-app camera.
Image Preview Screen: Display the saved cropped image.
